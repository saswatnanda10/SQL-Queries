1. Consider  P1(a,c)and P2(b,d)  to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b)  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d)are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

SOLUTION:

select round(sqrt(power(max(LAT_N) - min(LAT_N), 2) + power(max(LONG_W) - min(LONG_W), 2)), 4)
FROM STATION;

2. Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

SOLUTION:-

SELECT CASE
WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
ELSE 'Scalene'
END
FROM TRIANGLES;

3. Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

Sample Input

An OCCUPATIONS table that contains the following records:

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)
Samantha(D)
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.
There are a total of 3 professors.


SOLUTION:

SELECT CONCAT (NAME, '(', LEFT (OCCUPATION, 1), ')') as col1
FROM  OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY  NAME;
  
SELECT CONCAT ('There are a total of ', COUNT(OCCUPATION), ' ', lower (OCCUPATION), 's.') as col1
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION;
